# WhiteLabel-MS-Golang

This is a micro-servce template for Go that uses the best serverless principles:

- Simplicity
- Modularity
- TDD
- Hexagonal Architecture

## Why?

When developig a serverless Architecture, you can use this infrastructure as a Lambda Function, an AWS Fargate or a Lambda Container with unit testing and some or none modifications. This helps developing fast-paced and scalable applications.

## Run tests

```bash
go test ./useCases...
```

## Add new useCase

```bash
go run CLI/generateUseCase.go
```
